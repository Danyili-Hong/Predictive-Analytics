# Load Packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# DATA 202 hack for displaying plotly within RStudio:
if 'r' in globals() and r['.Platform$GUI'] == "RStudio" and r['suppressMessages(requireNamespace("htmltools"))']:
  r[".GlobalEnv$to_html <- function(x) { print(htmltools::HTML(x)) }"] and None
  def show_plot(p): r.to_html(p._repr_html_())
else:
  def show_plot(p): return p
# End hack
```

# Read Data

```{python}
daily_rides = pd.read_csv("https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/data/bikeshare/day_simple.csv", parse_dates=["date"])
```

# Exercise 1

There are 731 rows,each row is a different date

# Exercise 2

The following plot shows the total number of rides each day.

```{python}
show_plot(
  px.scatter(
    daily_rides,
    x="date", y="total_rides",
    trendline="lowess",
    labels={"date": "Date", "total_rides": "Number of Rides"}
    ))
```

# Exercise 3

The following plot shows the total number of rides for weekdays vs weekends.

```{python}
show_plot(
  px.scatter(
    daily_rides,
    x="date", y="total_rides",
    trendline="lowess",
    labels={"date": "Date", "total_rides": "Number of Rides"},color="workingday"
    ))
```

# Exercise 4

the number of rides for weekdays are generally smaller than the weekends. I think the most of the Capital Bikesahre riders are using bike to commute to work place.

# Reflections

It took me 40 minutes to finish it. I think I sometimes have trouble understanding the instructions.
