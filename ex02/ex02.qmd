# Load Packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# DATA 202 hack for displaying plotly within RStudio:
if 'r' in globals() and r['.Platform$GUI'] == "RStudio" and r['suppressMessages(requireNamespace("htmltools"))']:
  r[".GlobalEnv$to_html <- function(x) { print(htmltools::HTML(x)) }"] and None
  def show_plot(p): r.to_html(p._repr_html_())
else:
  def show_plot(p): return p
# End hack
```

# Read Data

```{python}
daily_rides = pd.read_csv("data/day_by_type.csv", parse_dates=["date"])
```

Example row:

```{python}
daily_rides.head(1).T.style.hide(axis='columns')
```

# Exercise 1

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
print("""
There are 1462 rows in the dataset. Each row represents all the information of a ride. 
""".format())
```

# Exercise 2

```{python}
weekdays = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]

def get_day_label(day_number):
  return weekdays[day_number]

daily_rides['day_of_week'] = daily_rides['day_of_week'].map(get_day_label)
```

# Exercise 3: Describe a row

on 2010-12-31 19:00:00, there were331 casual rides in winter on Saturday. The real temperature is 8.17 and it feels like 7.99. The humidity is 0.8 and the wind speed is 10.74.

# Exercise 4: Rides by date, by rider type

The following plot shows the number of rides each day, broken down by type of rider.

```{python}
show_plot(
  px.scatter(
    daily_rides,
    x="date", y="rides",
    trendline="lowess",
    labels={"date": "Date", "rides": "Number of Rides"},
    color = "rider_type"
    )
    .update_traces(marker_size= 3, marker_opacity = 0.5)
)
```

# Exercise 5
```{python}
show_plot(
  px.box(
    daily_rides,
    x="day_of_week", y="rides", color="rider_type", facet_col="season"
))
```

# Exercise 6
```{python}
show_plot(
  px.box(
    daily_rides,
    x="workingday", y="rides", color="weather_type"
))
```
The rides are being used the most in workdays during weather type 1.

reflection
The assignment was pretty clear after asking questions and I figured it out eventually. 
It took me an hour to finish this.
